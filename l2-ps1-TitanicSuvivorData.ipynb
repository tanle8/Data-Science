    "#### Assignment description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will perform some *rudimentary* practices similar to those of\n",
    "an actual data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of a data scientist's job is to use her or his `intuition` and `insight` to\n",
    "write `algorithms` and `heuristics`. A data scientist also creates `mathematical models` \n",
    "to make *predictions* based on some `attributes` from the data that they are examining.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic\n",
    "and its passengers' attributes to **predict** whether or not the passengers survived\n",
    "or perished. You can read more about the Titanic and specifics about this dataset at:\n",
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\n",
    "http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise and the following ones, you are given a `list of Titantic passengers`\n",
    "and their associated information. More information about the data can be seen at the \n",
    "link below:\n",
    "http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you need to write a simple `heuristic` that will use\n",
    "the `passengers' gender` to predict if that person survived the Titanic disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You prediction should be **78% accurate or higher**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple heuristic to start off:\n",
    "- 1) If the passenger is female, your heuristic should assume that the\n",
    "   passenger survived.\n",
    "- 2) If the passenger is male, you heuristic should\n",
    "   assume that the passenger did not survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the gender of a passenger via `passenger['Sex']`.\n",
    "- If the passenger is *male*, `passenger['Sex']` will return a string **\"male\"**.\n",
    "- If the passenger is *female*, `passenger['Sex']` will return a string **\"female\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your prediction back into the \"predictions\" dictionary. \n",
    "- The key of the dictionary should be the passenger's id (which can be accessed via passenger[\"PassengerId\"]) and the associated value should be \"1\" if the passenger survied or \"0\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, \n",
    "    - if a passenger is predicted to have survived:\n",
    "        - passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "        - predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n",
    "    - And if a passenger is predicted to have perished in the disaster:\n",
    "        - passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "        - predictions[passenger_id] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also look at the Titantic data that you will be working with\n",
