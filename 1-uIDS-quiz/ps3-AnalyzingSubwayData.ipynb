    "http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/6/curve-fitting/index.htm?reg_analysischeck_linearreg.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis checklist: Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Can the relationship between X and Y be graphed as a **straight line**?\n",
    "    In many experiments the relationship between X and Y is curved, making linear regression inappropriate. It rarely helps to transform the data to force the relationship to be linear. Better, use nonlinear curve fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Is the scatter of data around the line Gaussian (at least approximately)?\n",
    "    Linear regression analysis assumes that the scatter of data around the best-fit line is Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Is the variability the same everywhere?\n",
    "    Linear regression assumes that scatter of points around the best-fit line has the same standard deviation all along the curve. The assumption is violated if the points with high or low X values tend to be further from the best-fit line. The assumption that the standard deviation is the same everywhere is termed homoscedasticity. (If the scatter goes up as Y goes up, you need to perform a weighted regression. Prism can't do this via the linear regression analysis. Instead, use nonlinear regression but choose to fit to a straight-line model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Do you know the X values precisely?\n",
    "    The linear regression model assumes that X values are exactly correct, and that experimental error or biological variability only affects the Y values. This is rarely the case, but it is sufficient to assume that any imprecision in measuring X is very small compared to the variability in Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Are the data points independent?\n",
